        Children's slide bikes are used for children to play and rely on children to push on the ground to provide the power for the bicycle to move forward. The speed is related to the strength and frequency of pushing on the ground, and the speed fluctuates greatly. The speed control device can realize the energy storage when the speed is higher than the set speed and release the stored energy when the speed is lower than the set speed, so as to reduce the speed fluctuation and improve the comfort of playing.
